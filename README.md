# NTTDATA
In March 2022, NTT DATA challenged the class with a business game to solve using Machine Learning. We’re going to dive in our models and the reasons which have driven our algorithmic choices.
The client is the CMO of an e-commerce which aggregates smaller independent sellers operating in Spain. We acted like a consulting team for NTT to build machine learning models to increase the performances and profits, leveraging three key activities:

* Customers’ clustering: segmenting customers based on similar features to create ad hoc marketing strategies.
* Recommendation System: algorithms to predict which are the products each user can be interested in purchasing.
* Delivery Time Analysis: to predict an accurate date of delivery for customers and getting insights on the drivers which influence the shipping time.

Realized by:
* Amadori M. - ML Specialist
* Caccavale F. - ML Specialist
* Gioia M. - Business Specialist
* Imperatore C. - Consultant
* Striano V. J. - Team Leader
